description: Byron's exuberant masterpiece tells of the adventures of Don Juan, beginning
  with his illicit love affair at the age of sixteen in his native Spain and his subsequent
  exile to Italy. Following a dramatic shipwreck, his exploits take him to Greece,
  where he is sold as a slave, and to Russia, where he becomes a favorite of the Empress
  Catherine who sends him on to England. Written in ottava rima stanza form, Byron's
  Don Juan blends high drama with earthy humor, outrageous satire of his contemporaries,
  and sharp mockery of Western societies, with England coming under particular attack.
